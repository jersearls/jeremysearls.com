Hi there! I live in Kalamazoo Michigan and work remotely as an Elixir software engineer for Cars.com. I have a passion for micro-controllers and tinkering with household inventions. Before working in software, I was a firefighter by trade and have a degree in clinical medicine. I LOVE helping people, and that's why I started this blog. My greatest hope would be that someone stumbles across it and it makes their life a little easier.
